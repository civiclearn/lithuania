  <h1>About the Lithuanian Citizenship Exam</h1>

  <!-- ===============================
       1. PURPOSE AND REQUIREMENTS
  ================================== -->
  <h2>1. Purpose and requirements</h2>

  <p>
    The Lithuanian citizenship exam is a mandatory procedure for individuals
    applying for citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania through
    naturalisation. The purpose of the exam is to assess whether the applicant
    has a sufficient understanding of the foundations of the Lithuanian state,
    its constitutional order, the rights and duties of citizens,
    and the basic principles governing the functioning of the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    This exam is not symbolic or purely formal. Its purpose is to ensure that
    future citizens understand how the Lithuanian state operates,
    which values underpin it, and what responsibilities citizenship entails
    in a democratic society.
  </p>

  <p>
    The content of the exam is directly based on the
    Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and other fundamental legal acts
    defining the state system, the separation of powers,
    human rights, and civic obligations.
  </p>

  <h3>Who is required to take this exam?</h3>

  <p>
    The Lithuanian citizenship exam must be taken by most individuals who:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>reside permanently in Lithuania;</li>
    <li>apply for Lithuanian citizenship through naturalisation;</li>
    <li>do not fall under statutory exemptions from the exam.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The exam is one of several conditions that must be fulfilled together with
    language proficiency requirements, minimum residence periods,
    and other legal criteria.
  </p>

  <h3>Why is the exam mandatory?</h3>

  <p>
    Citizenship grants not only rights, but also responsibilities.
    The state expects its citizens to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>understand the constitutional foundations of the state;</li>
    <li>know how democratic institutions function;</li>
    <li>be aware of their rights and responsibilities within society.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The exam is not designed to test academic or historical trivia.
    It focuses on essential understanding: how the Lithuanian state works,
    what the Seimas, the President, the Government and the courts are,
    and what the core rights and duties of citizens are.
  </p>

  <h3>Are there any exemptions?</h3>

  <p>
    Lithuanian law provides for certain cases in which an individual
    may be exempt from taking the citizenship exam.
    Such exemptions are typically related to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>age;</li>
    <li>health conditions;</li>
    <li>other circumstances explicitly defined by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    However, for the majority of applicants,
    the exam is an unavoidable stage of the process,
    which makes systematic preparation essential.
  </p>
  
  
    <!-- ===============================
       2. EXAM FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
  ================================== -->
  <h2>2. Exam format and structure</h2>

  <p>
    The Lithuanian citizenship exam is structured in a way that allows for
    an objective assessment of an applicant’s knowledge of the foundations
    of the Lithuanian state. The exam is not an open-ended interview – its
    format, question types, and assessment criteria are defined in advance.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, the exam is usually taken in written form.
    Applicants are presented with questions for which they must select
    the correct answer or respond according to the specified format.
    The purpose of the exam is not to catch candidates on minor details,
    but to verify whether they understand the core concepts and principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    The exam is conducted in the Lithuanian language.
    For this reason, preparation for the citizenship exam is closely linked
    to language proficiency – even when the constitutional content is well
    understood, applicants must be able to read and correctly interpret
    the wording of the questions.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of questions</h3>

  <p>The questions presented during the exam are typically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>multiple-choice questions;</li>
    <li>formulated on the basis of constitutional provisions
        and their practical application;</li>
    <li>
      focused on the structure of the state, public authorities,
      and the rights and duties of citizens.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The questions are not random. They reflect topics that are considered
    essential for a citizen’s understanding of how the state functions.
  </p>

  <h3>Exam duration and procedure</h3>

  <p>
    The exam is conducted within a limited time frame,
    during which the applicant must answer all questions.
    The allotted time is sufficient to consider the answers,
    but it is not unlimited – therefore, it is important not only
    to know the correct answers, but also to be familiar with
    the question format.
  </p>

  <p>During the exam:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the use of reference materials is not permitted;</li>
    <li>mobile phones or other electronic devices are not allowed;</li>
    <li>all answers must be provided independently.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why understanding the structure matters</h3>

  <p>
    Many applicants underestimate the importance of understanding
    the exam structure and focus exclusively on reading theoretical material.
    In practice, however:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>even well-prepared candidates may make mistakes
        due to question wording;</li>
    <li>time pressure can affect performance;</li>
    <li>unfamiliar question styles may cause additional stress.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Effective preparation therefore includes not only reading
    the Constitution, but also working with practice tests that
    help candidates become familiar with the structure of the exam
    and the logic behind the questions.
  </p>

  
  
    <!-- ===============================
       3. TOPICS AND CONTENT
  ================================== -->
  <h2>3. Topics and content</h2>

  <p>
    The content of the Lithuanian citizenship exam is defined in the official
    programme for the Fundamentals of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania.
    Exam questions are based on the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania,
    and the topics cover all key areas of state structure, public authorities,
    human rights, and social life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Questions are drawn from all sections of the Constitution.
    For this reason, preparation must be systematic and comprehensive,
    rather than limited to one or two selected topics.
  </p>

  <h3>The Lithuanian state</h3>

  <p>
    This group of topics assesses knowledge of the foundations of the Lithuanian
    state and its constitutional order. It includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the form of government and political system;</li>
    <li>the principle of national sovereignty;</li>
    <li>the institutions exercising state power;</li>
    <li>the supremacy of the Constitution and the law;</li>
    <li>referendums;</li>
    <li>the territory of the Lithuanian state;</li>
    <li>citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania;</li>
    <li>the state language;</li>
    <li>state symbols – the flag, coat of arms, and national anthem.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These topics form the foundation for understanding how the state
    is organised and which principles govern its functioning.
  </p>

  <h3>The individual and the state</h3>

  <p>
    This group of topics focuses on fundamental human rights and freedoms
    enshrined in the Constitution. During the exam, knowledge may be assessed on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the right to life;</li>
    <li>the inviolability of personal liberty and human dignity;</li>
    <li>the inviolability of private life and the home;</li>
    <li>property rights;</li>
    <li>freedom of thought, conscience, and religion;</li>
    <li>the right to hold and express beliefs;</li>
    <li>the principle of equality before the law;</li>
    <li>the right to apply to a court;</li>
    <li>voting rights;</li>
    <li>the right to form associations and political parties;</li>
    <li>conditions under which human rights and freedoms may be restricted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is important not only to know the names of these rights,
    but also to understand in which situations and under what conditions
    they may be lawfully limited.
  </p>

  <h3>Society and the state</h3>

  <p>
    This section examines the relationship between the state
    and social institutions, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the relationship between the family and the state;</li>
    <li>the role of science in the Republic of Lithuania;</li>
    <li>the principle of separation between religion, the Church, and the state;</li>
    <li>freedom of the mass media and the prohibition of censorship.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These topics illustrate how the Constitution regulates social life
    and fundamental societal values.
  </p>

  <h3>The national economy and labour</h3>

  <p>
    The exam also assesses knowledge of economic and social foundations, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the principles of the Lithuanian economy;</li>
    <li>objects of exclusive state ownership;</li>
    <li>the right to work and to engage in business;</li>
    <li>the right to strike;</li>
    <li>the right to safe and healthy working conditions;</li>
    <li>social security and healthcare.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These topics relate to the social and economic rights of citizens.
  </p>

  <h3>State authorities</h3>

  <p>
    A significant part of the exam is devoted to state authorities
    and their respective functions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Seimas</strong>:
      elections, the status, rights and duties of its members,
      legislative procedures, sessions, impeachment,
      and oversight institutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The President of the Republic</strong>:
      the role of the head of state, elections, powers,
      immunity, termination of powers, and temporary substitution.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Government</strong>:
      composition, appointment of the Prime Minister and ministers,
      functions, responsibility, and resignation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Constitutional Court</strong>:
      composition, appointment of judges, jurisdiction, and decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Courts and the prosecution service</strong>:
      the court system, administration of justice,
      appointment and dismissal of judges,
      and the Prosecutor General.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These topics assess understanding of how the principle
    of separation of powers operates in practice.
  </p>

  <h3>Local government, public finance, and state activity</h3>

  <p>The exam also covers topics related to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>elections to municipal councils and their powers;</li>
    <li>the organisation of local self-government;</li>
    <li>the public finance system;</li>
    <li>the state budget and its approval;</li>
    <li>the functions of the National Audit Office;</li>
    <li>foreign policy and national defence;</li>
    <li>regulation of martial law and states of emergency;</li>
    <li>procedures for amending the Constitution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These topics complement the overall understanding
    of how the state functions across different areas.
  </p>



  <!-- ===============================
       4. ASSESSMENT AND PASSING CRITERIA
  ================================== -->
  <h2>4. Assessment and passing criteria</h2>

  <p>
    The assessment procedure for the Lithuanian citizenship exam
    is clearly defined in the official programme for the
    Fundamentals of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania.
    Assessment is based on objective criteria and is applied
    uniformly to all individuals taking the exam.
  </p>

  <h3>Exam format and number of questions</h3>

  <p>
    The Fundamentals of the Constitution exam is taken in written form,
    and its format is a test. The test consists of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>20 questions;</li>
    <li>three possible answer options for each question;</li>
    <li>only one correct answer per question.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When taking the exam, candidates must select
    the single correct answer option for each question.
  </p>

  <h3>Passing criteria</h3>

  <p>The exam is considered passed if the candidate:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>answers at least 14 out of 20 questions correctly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This means that the passing threshold corresponds
    to a majority of correct answers,
    and random guessing is not sufficient to pass the exam.
  </p>

  <h3>Principles of assessment</h3>

  <p>Assessment is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>quantitative – based on the number of correct answers;</li>
    <li>objective – all candidates are assessed using the same system;</li>
    <li>individual – each exam attempt is assessed separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    During the exam, explanations or justifications
    for answers are not evaluated –
    only the selection of the correct answer is taken into account.
  </p>

  <h3>Oral examination</h3>

  <p>
    In cases where an individual is unable to take the exam in written form
    for objective reasons (for example, due to a disability),
    it may be possible to take the exam orally.
  </p>

  <p>In the case of an oral examination:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the exam format remains a test;</li>
    <li>questions are drawn from the same topics;</li>
    <li>
      the same assessment criteria apply
      as for the written examination.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This ensures that identical requirements are applied
    to all candidates, regardless of the exam format.
  </p>

  <h3>What does failing the exam mean?</h3>

  <p>
    If the required number of correct answers is not achieved,
    the exam is considered failed.
    In such cases, the citizenship application process
    cannot continue until the exam has been successfully passed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Failing the exam is not a final decision on citizenship.
    It means that the applicant must prepare further
    and take the exam again.
  </p>


  <!-- ===============================
       5. PREPARING FOR THE EXAM: A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
  ================================== -->
  <h2>5. Preparing for the exam: a systematic approach</h2>

  <p>
    The content of the Lithuanian citizenship exam is clearly defined,
    but the preparation process itself is often underestimated.
    Simply reading the Constitution or briefly reviewing topics
    does not always lead to a successful result,
    as exam questions test not only memory,
    but also understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effective preparation is based on systematic work
    across all topic groups defined in the official exam programme.
  </p>

  <h3>Why reading the Constitution alone is not enough</h3>

  <p>
    The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania is the primary source
    for the exam. However:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>its language is legal and abstract;</li>
    <li>many articles are interconnected;</li>
    <li>exam questions are often formulated indirectly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This means that applicants must not only recognise
    constitutional provisions, but also understand
    their practical meaning. Without practice,
    there is a risk of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>confusing similar concepts;</li>
    <li>misinterpreting the wording of a question;</li>
    <li>losing points due to small but important distinctions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Principles of systematic preparation</h3>

  <p>When preparing for the exam, it is recommended to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>study by topic rather than in a random order;</li>
    <li>
      cover all sections of the Constitution,
      without focusing only on the most frequently mentioned institutions;
    </li>
    <li>regularly revise previously studied topics;</li>
    <li>
      work with test-style questions
      similar to those used in the actual exam.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This approach helps build a coherent understanding,
    rather than isolated and disconnected knowledge.
  </p>

  <h3>The importance of practice tests</h3>

  <p>Practice tests help candidates to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>become familiar with the structure of the questions;</li>
    <li>identify key elements in question wording;</li>
    <li>manage time more effectively during the exam;</li>
    <li>identify weaker topics that require additional attention.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Practice is what allows candidates to move
    from theoretical knowledge to the real exam format.
  </p>

  <h3>How long does preparation take?</h3>

  <p>Preparation time depends on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the applicant’s prior knowledge;</li>
    <li>their level of Lithuanian language comprehension;</li>
    <li>the intensity of study.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The key factor is not speed, but consistency.
    Regular work with constitutional topics
    and practice questions helps gradually consolidate knowledge
    and reduce stress on exam day.
  </p>

  <h3>The goal of preparation</h3>

  <p>
    The goal of preparation is not to memorise answers.
    The objective is to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>understand the structure of the Lithuanian state;</li>
    <li>be aware of the rights and duties of citizens;</li>
    <li>
      be able to apply constitutional principles
      to the questions presented in the exam.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Such preparation not only increases the likelihood
    of passing the exam, but also provides a genuine understanding
    of the state whose citizenship is being sought.
  </p>



  <!-- ===============================
       FAQ
  ================================== -->
  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>Is there an official list of exam questions to memorise?</h3>
  <p>
    No. There is no officially published fixed list of exam questions.
    Questions are prepared based on the official programme for the
    Fundamentals of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania
    and may cover all sections of the Constitution.
  </p>

  <h3>Do exam questions repeat?</h3>
  <p>
    The exam programme does not provide for a single, predictable
    set of questions. For this reason, it is important to study
    the topics systematically rather than rely on isolated examples.
  </p>

  <h3>In which language is the exam conducted?</h3>
  <p>
    The Fundamentals of the Constitution exam is conducted
    <strong>in Lithuanian</strong>.
    Candidates must be able to understand the wording of questions
    and the answer options.
  </p>

  <h3>Can the exam be retaken if it is not passed?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. If the exam is not passed, it may be taken again.
    Passing the exam is a mandatory requirement for the continuation
    of the citizenship application process.
  </p>

  <h3>Is this exam required only for citizenship?</h3>
  <p>
    The Fundamentals of the Constitution exam applies to individuals
    applying for Lithuanian citizenship and, in certain cases,
    to applicants for permanent residence.
    The topics and assessment principles are the same.
  </p>

  <!-- ===============================
       SUMMARY
  ================================== -->
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    The Lithuanian citizenship exam is a clearly structured
    and regulated process based on the Constitution of the
    Republic of Lithuania. Successfully passing the exam requires
    more than familiarity with the constitutional text;

    the functioning of state institutions,
    and the rights and duties of citizens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Systematic preparation that covers all topics defined
    in the official programme and includes practice questions
    helps candidates approach the exam with confidence
    and reduces uncertainty on exam day.
